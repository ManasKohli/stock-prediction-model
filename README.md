# NVIDIA Stock Price Prediction with LSTM Neural Networks

A machine learning project that uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to predict NVIDIA stock prices. This project leverages TensorFlow's Sequential API to build and train a deep learning model capable of forecasting stock price movements based on historical data.

## 📋 Overview

This project implements a time-series forecasting model using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks to predict NVIDIA stock prices. LSTMs are particularly well-suited for time-series prediction tasks due to their ability to learn long-term dependencies in sequential data.

## ✨ Features

- **LSTM-based Prediction**: Utilizes deep LSTM neural networks for accurate stock price forecasting
- **TensorFlow Sequential Model**: Built using TensorFlow's high-level Sequential API for ease of use
- **Historical Data Analysis**: Trains on historical NVIDIA stock price data
- **Time-Series Forecasting**: Predicts future stock prices based on past patterns and trends
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes data normalization and sequence preparation for optimal model performance

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Deep learning framework for building and training the LSTM model
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Data visualization (optional)
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive development environment

## 📦 Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required Python packages (see Installation section)

## 🔧 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd stock-prediction-model
```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install tensorflow pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter yfinance
```

Or install from a requirements file (if available):
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Usage

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

2. Open `main.ipynb` and run the cells sequentially to:
   - Load and preprocess NVIDIA stock data
   - Prepare training and testing datasets
   - Build and compile the LSTM model
   - Train the model on historical data
   - Evaluate model performance
   - Make predictions on future stock prices

3. The model will:
   - Split data into training (70%), validation (15%), and testing (15%) sets
   - Normalize the data for better model convergence
   - Create sequences of historical data as input features
   - Train the LSTM network to learn patterns
   - Generate predictions and visualize results

## 🧠 Model Architecture

The model uses a Sequential architecture with LSTM layers:

- **Input Layer**: Time-series sequences of stock price data
- **LSTM Layers**: One or more LSTM layers with varying units to capture temporal patterns
- **Dropout Layers**: Regularization to prevent overfitting
- **Dense Layer**: Output layer for price predictions

### Typical Model Structure:
```python
model = Sequential([
    LSTM(50, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(time_steps, features)),
    Dropout(0.2),
    LSTM(50, return_sequences=False),
    Dropout(0.2),
    Dense(1)
])
```

## 📊 Results

The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Visual comparison of predicted vs. actual stock prices

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is for educational and research purposes only. Stock market predictions are inherently uncertain, and past performance does not guarantee future results. Always consult with financial advisors before making investment decisions. The predictions generated by this model should not be considered as financial advice.
